# Amazon-Clone
This project involves designing and developing a fully functional Amazon-like e-commerce frontend using React. The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate practical understanding of modern React concepts such as component-based architecture, routing, global state management, conditional rendering, and responsive UI design.

The application replicates the core user interface and workflow of an e-commerce platform like Amazon, allowing users to browse products, view detailed product information, manage a shopping cart, authenticate users, and proceed to checkout—all within a smooth single-page application experience.

## Key Features Implemented
Homepage displaying a list of products in card format with image, title, price, and rating, along with a basic search/filter bar.

Product Detail Page that shows complete product information and allows users to add items to the cart.

Cart Page where users can view selected items, update quantities, remove products, and see the total price dynamically.

Checkout Page providing a billing summary and a shipping address form (UI-only, no backend integration).

User Authentication using mock data or localStorage, enabling sign-up and login functionality with conditional UI rendering.

Routing implemented using React Router for seamless navigation between pages.

Global State Management using Context API with useReducer (or Redux Toolkit) to manage cart and user state across the application.

Responsive Design ensuring the UI adapts well to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using CSS Flexbox/Grid or utility libraries like Tailwind CSS.

Clean Code Structure with proper folder organization, reusable components, and readable naming conventions.
